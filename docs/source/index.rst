:command:`This documentation describes the released Andover branch of SHARPpy.`

SHARPpy is a collection of open source sounding and hodograph analysis routines, a sounding plotting package, and an interactive, *cross-platform* application for analyzing real-time soundings all written in Python. It was developed to provide the atmospheric science community a free and consistent source of sounding analysis routines. SHARPpy is constantly updated and vetted by professional meteorologists and climatologists within the scientific community to help maintain a standard source of sounding routines.

We currently support Python >= 3.6.
